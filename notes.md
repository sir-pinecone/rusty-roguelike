- I tried to move the objects vector into the GameState struct. I was able to remove all
  errors except for the ones generated by the mut_two fn calls. Since that fn requires a
  mutable borrow of the game_state, I can't use the game_state after the call. I don't
  know an alternative way to solving this and I don't think I have to devise one any time
  soon. I'm sure I'll revisit this same problem or a similar one in the near future.
